= I have successfully restored a category using the TP Restore Categories And Taxonomies plugin, but I'm encountering a 404 error when I try to access the category page. What could be causing this issue and how can I resolve it? =

This issue often arises due to problems with the .htaccess file, which manages the permalink structure of your WordPress website. Sometimes, restoring a category or making changes to your themes or plugins can disrupt this file, resulting in 404 errors when trying to access certain pages.

To resolve this, you simply need to resave your permalink structure. Here's how you can do it:

    1. Go to your WordPress dashboard.
    2. Click on "Settings," then select "Permalinks."
    3. Without making any changes, click on the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the page.

Resaving your permalinks will refresh the rules in the .htaccess file and often fix any issues related to accessing restored categories or other pages on your website.
